# Server

The server directory contains the server files for hosting the visualization and
data collection portal of the wearable device.

## Server Configuration

A public version of the server is accessible via my personal [website][website].
However, running the server locally will also work. By default it is configured
to run locally on port 32321. To send data to the server the client will need
to be run in local mode.
